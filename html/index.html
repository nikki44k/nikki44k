        <h4> Majoring in Computer Science, University of Idaho </h4>
          <p> I'm a sophomore student who likes to learn something new, painting, sleep and 
watch something while workingon my code. Right now, I'm working on html and css to start a new project 
to build a website which tells all about what I do and my deatils and this is page is something as 
source where I'm starting from scratch. Don't mind I really don't know whta I'm about to create but 
hoping for the best.</p>
