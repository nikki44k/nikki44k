        <h2> All About Me </h2>
        <h4> Majoring in Computer Science, University of Idaho </h4>
          <p> I'm a sophomore student who likes to learn something new, painting, sleep and 
watch something while working on my code. Right now, I'm working on html and css to start a new project 
to build a website which tells all about what I do and my details and this page is something as my 
beginning source where I'm starting from scratch. Don't mind I really don't know what I'm about to create 
but let's hope for the best.</p>
        <div class = "data">
        <a href = "#" class = "learning">I'm just learning to do something good with html and css.</a>
