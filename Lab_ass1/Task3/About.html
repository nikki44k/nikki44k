        <h1> About Me </h1>
        <h3> <u> Who Am I? </u> </h3>
		<img src = "MyImage2.jpg" class = "pic" width = "300" height = "400"> <br>
		
		<p> Originally from India, I came to the United States at the age of 17 to pursue a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science at the University of Idaho. Moving to a new country at such a young age was challenging, and adapting to a different culture and environment was not easy. However, through perseverance and a passion for learning, I have managed to grow both personally and academically. Today, I am proud of the journey I’ve been on and grateful for the experiences that have shaped me.</p>

		<h3> <u> Academic Focus </u> </h3>
		<img src = "MyImage4.jpeg" class = "pic" width = "300" height = "300"> <br>

		<p> As a Computer Science student, I have developed a deep interest in several areas, including software development, operating systems, computer architecture, and database systems. My coursework at the University of Idaho has allowed me to explore these subjects in detail, giving me a strong foundation in programming, systems design, and data management. Each new class presents an opportunity to build on my knowledge, and I’m excited to continue growing in these areas as I progress in my degree.</p>

		<h3> <u> Skills and Interests </u> </h3>
		<p>In terms of technical skills, I have developed a solid foundation in: </p>
		<pre>
			Python                 Machine Language
			C/C++		        HTML and CSS
			SML			    Prolog
			Java 			 OS/Unix History
			Linux			 JavaScript
		</pre>  
		<p>I really enjoy doing math in my free time because it keeps my mind sharp and challenges me to think critically.
		Python, in particular, has become one of my favorite languages for solving problems and creating efficient code. My passion for coding is complemented by my love for math, which enhances my ability to think logically and solve complex problems. In addition to these technical interests, I’ve enjoyed exploring new places, making friends, and becoming more comfortable in my new environment.</p>

		<h3> <u> Overcoming Challenges </u> </h3>
		<p>Moving to a new country at 17 came with its own set of challenges. The transition was not easy, as I had to adjust to a new culture, make new friends, and adapt to a different style of education. There were moments when I felt overwhelmed by the change, but with time and effort, I learned to navigate this new chapter in my life. I’m proud to say that I’ve grown through these struggles, and today, I’m happy to be part of a community where I’m continuously learning and growing.</p>
