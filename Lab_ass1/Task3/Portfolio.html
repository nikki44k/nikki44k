		<h3> <u> Education and Skills</u> </h3>
		<p>At the University of Idaho, I have completed coursework that has provided me with a solid foundation in computer science principles. I am proficient in programming languages such as Python, C/C++, SML, Java, ML, Prolog, HTML, and CSS. My skills extend to solving algorithms and working with various software tools, including Microsoft Word and Outlook. Additionally, I have knowledge of Unix, Linux- Ubuntu, and software development concepts related to OS/Unix history. I am also familiar with JavaScript and machine languages, which complements my technical skill set.</p>

		<h3> <u> Professional Experience </u> </h3>

		<p> In my role with Athletic Video Support, I have been responsible for filming and editing football practices, games, and special events. This position has honed my skills in video production, from capturing high-quality footage to assisting with equipment setup and takedown. Traveling with the football team for away games has provided me with valuable experience in managing video operations in diverse environments. This role has not only developed my technical abilities but also enhanced my teamwork and organizational skills.</p>

		<h3> <u> Volunteer Experience </u> </h3>
		<p>My involvement in volunteering has been a significant part of my university experience. As a volunteer at the Cruise the World Event, I collaborated with international students to promote cultural awareness and inclusivity. I played a key role in event planning, setting up booths, and organizing activities, which contributed to the event's success. Additionally, I served as a volunteer speaker for the INTR 101 course, where I shared my experiences as an international student and provided guidance on academic and personal growth. These experiences have allowed me to develop strong communication and leadership skills while making a positive impact on my community.</p>

        <h3> <u> Current Projects and Future Goals </u> </h3>

		<p>Last semester, I had the opportunity to work on a group project where my teammates and I developed a 2D video game as part of one of our classes. My primary responsibility was building the core functionality of the game and ensuring that it could run smoothly on various platforms, including Android and iOS. We used Unity as our development platform and coded in C#, which allowed us to create a cross-platform experience. This project not only enhanced my skills in game development but also taught me the importance of collaboration and problem-solving in a team setting.</p>
		<p>In this project, I was also responsible for creating the player characters and their prefabs using Unity and C#. My role involved designing and implementing the playerâ€™s functionality and ensuring that these elements were compatible with both Android and iOS platforms. This experience not only enhanced my skills in game development but also provided me with valuable insights into cross-platform compatibility and collaborative project work. Looking ahead, I am excited to apply my skills to new challenges, whether in software development, game design, or mobile application development, and to continue contributing to impactful projects in the tech industry.</p>

		<p>Moving forward this semseter, I am going to team up with one of my classmate to Implement a project and I'm eager to take on more challenging projects that push the boundaries of my skills. Whether it's in software development, game design, or mobile app development, I aim to contribute to projects that have real-world impact. I look forward to expanding my expertise, particularly in cross-platform development, and applying my knowledge to create innovative, efficient, and user-friendly applications.</p>
