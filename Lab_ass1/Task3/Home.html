	<p>I'm currently working towards my bachelor's degree in Computer Science at University of Idaho. My interests are currently centered around Software Development, Operating Systems, Computer Architecture and Database Sysytems but I’m also open to exploring new areas of technology. One of my goals is to work on projects that have a real-world impact, whether it's through creating innovative software solutions or optimizing systems to be more efficient. I’m excited to continue learning and growing as a developer, and I look forward to seeing where my skills take me.</p>
